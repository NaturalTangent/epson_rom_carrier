# Epson PX-8 / PX-4 ROM Carrier

This is a 3d printable ROM carrier for mounting ROMs in the capsule sockets of the Epson PX-8 and PX-4 computers.

You may need to tweak some of the measurements (near the top of RomCapsule.scad) if your 3d printer performs differently to mine.

The STL file can be generated by loading RomCapsule.scad into OpenSCAD (https://www.openscad.org/).

When printing you will need to enable supports to allow the horizontal tabs to print successfully.
